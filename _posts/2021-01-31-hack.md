This article contains some of the **hack**s I learned and used during my study and work. I applied them mostly because they are **cool** or useful. These hacks help me to feel cool myself. I write them down here in the hope that they can make your work easier and cooler.

## Shell

### Run jobs without `stdout` messages

*on* **31/Jan/2021**

While developing hardware with Vivado, you would probably get a lot of `stdout` messages. To make your stdout clean while keeping those messages in a file, you can:

```bash
# to run command while keeping your stdout clean
$ command > command.log 2>&1 &
[1] 27736

# then check your running job
$ jobs -l
[1]+ 27736 Running                 make installip > installip.log 2>&1 &
```

Here you out put the `stdout` into file `command.log` and output your `stderr` as `stdout`.

> `>&` is the syntax to redirect a stream to another file descriptor - `0` is `stdin`, `1` is `stdout`, and `2` is `stderr`.

### Keep job running after exiting shell

*on* **31/Jan/2021**

When you developing on a remote server over `ssh`, a time consuming job might be pretty annoying. Because it occupys a shell window for nothing and make you unable to shundown your laptop. To solve this, you can use:

```bash
# list current jobs
$ jobs -l
[1]+ 27736 Running                 make installip > installip.log 2>&1 &

# disown your job with job id
$ disown %1

# now this job is not own by you
$ jobs -l
```

### Find file

*on* **30/Jan/2021**

To find a file that matches a regular expression, you can use:

```shell
$ find . -name '<expression>'

# example
$ find . -name '*.exe'
./hello_world.exe
```

So this basically find you all files with `.exe` file extention in your current `.` directory.

### Print the directory tree

*on* **01/Feb/2021**

```shell
# print all the structure for current dir
$ tree .

# print only folders
$ tree -d

### Avoid SSH logout freezing

*on* **02/Jun/2021**

In some cases when you ssh to a remote host with X forwarding (i.e. `ssh -X ...`), it might freeze at logout. This is due to some processes haven't ended their stdout/stderr stream. To go through this, you might need `^c` to end the freezing logout. However, noone likes `^c`. A better workaround is to use **ssh escape characters**.

Hit the following sequence: `Enter`, `~`, `.`.

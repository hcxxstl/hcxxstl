## Avoid SSH logout freezing

In some cases when you ssh to a remote host with X forwarding (i.e. `ssh -X ...`), it might freeze at logout. This is due to some processes haven't ended their stdout/stderr stream. To go through this, you might need `^c` to end the freezing logout. However, no one likes `^c`. A better workaround is to use **ssh escape characters**.

Hit the following sequence: `Enter`, `~`, `.`.
